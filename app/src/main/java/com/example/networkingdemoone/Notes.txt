Networking and Android
    Network calls from main thread are NOT allowed!!
    ALL INTERNET APPS MUST USE THE INTERNET SYSTEM PERMISSION
    Generally, we use the network to request data for online sources
    or to send data to an online source
        this act is generally referred to as "Consuming API Calls"
    In Android we have a few common libraries to achieve Network Calls
        JAVA Native
            HttpURLConnection
            First must instantiate the URL Object
            Then open a HttpURLConnection using the URL object
            Buffer through the result form connection
            Close connection
            You Must define a threading scheme
        Third Party Libs.
            Retrofit
                Uses a OkHttp3 client
                Uses interface with Call object returns
                Interface are annotated with the proper Http Verb that interface is for
                Has built in (from okhttp3) Sync and Async capabilities
                    Sync function  = execution()
                    Async function = enqueue()
                Uses a Converter factory to convert results to objects
                Uses a Call factory adapter to interact with SOME threading schemes more seamlessly
                    RxJava
                    Coroutines
                Most commonly used when third parties are allowed
            Okhttp (current version = 3, OkHttp3)
                    Sync function  = execution()
                    Async function = enqueue()
            Volley
                A httpurlconnection client
        Not used a lot
            Spring Boot
    REST vs SOAP
        SOAP
            Older
            Only returns XMLs
            Protocol based
            Slower
            kSoap was the common lib used for SOAP in android

        REST
            Newer
            Returns many formats
            Faster

    JSON
        Most returns nowadays are using JSON formats for results
        JAVA SCRIPT OBJECT NOTATION
        Parse responses formatted intoa Json into Objects (POJO or DATA class)
            2 Methods
                Java Native
                    JSON Parser
                Google way
                    GSON Parser
                        Google JSON Parser
